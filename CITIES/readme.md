# Cities

<h3>General notes:</h3>

<p>Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib exercise. Using a web service in order to perform data analysis. OpenWeatherMap API is used to determine whether distance from the sea of a city influences temperatures, humidity and wind speed.

No correlation was shown in the sample, but the results are unimportant for the exercise due to the nature of the data, sample size, etc. Emphasis is put on the structure of the approach and the shape of the result rather than on the numbers themselves.</p>

<h3>Notes about subjects explored:</h3>

+ <h4> obtain data from web service</h4>

	> data regarding temperature, humidity and pressure was gather via publicly available API into pandas data frames

+ <h4> basic data analysis</h4>

	> data of interest was extracted, cleaned and prepared for comparison and a few plots were made in order to gain basic insight into what the data looks like

+ <h4> correlations in real-world data</h4>

	> scatter plots were made in order to inspect possible correlations, wind rose plot was made in order to determine prevailing wind directions and velocities.
