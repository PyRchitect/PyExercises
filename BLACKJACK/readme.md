# Blackjack

<h3>General notes:</h3>

<p>Using a well-known procedure to explore object separation and dynamical inputs. The game is incomplete, only basic rules were implemented</p>

<h3>Notes about subjects explored:</h3>

+ <h4> separating objects into classes</h4>

	> Game, Cards and Player objects are created, equiped with methods and attributes pertaining to their role.

+ <h4> dynamical result evaluation</h4>

	> the board is evaluated after each turn, score is calculated after each game, data is accessed and analyzed at different stages.

+ <h4> testing data structures on given dynamics</h4>

	> data analysis is performed using different representation in order to compare resulting complexity and possible advantages of each approach.
