<h3>General notes:</h3>

<p>Using a well-known procedure (turn based game) to explore a generally useful algorithm.</p>

<h3>Notes about subjects explored:</h3>

+ <h4> minimax</h4>

	> Minimax algorithm is a widely used decision mechanism applicable in various fields of work and research.
	
	> The well-known TTT game is used as a template to explore the basic variation of the algorithm. Since the TTT game is solved, results and possibilities are known, so the emphasis is put on the procedure itself.

	> The human player can play against the computer, the computer uses the minimax algorithm to predict moves. It is possible to stage computer vs computer games.

	> Algorithm optimizations, such as pruning based on number of moves to win is not employed.
