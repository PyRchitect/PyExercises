# Algorithms

<h3>General notes:</h3>

<p>Collection of exercises mainly focused on tree-like structures</p>


<h3>Notes about algorithms explored:</h3>

+ <h4> binary_search.py</h4>

	> Performs a simple binary search through a sorted list, using a target. Mode variable controls middle splitting. Able to search ascending and descending lists. Returns index of target.

+ <h4> hanoi.py</h4>

	> ASCII animation of hanoi towers algorithm. Able to set height of the disk stack.

+ <h4> horner.py</h4>

	> calculates polynomial division by a monic poly using Horner's rule, prints result, remainder and evaluation @x0 (test value).

+ <h4> inversions.py</h4>

	> calculates number of inversions of a permutation using a variation of the merge sort algorithm.

+ <h4> last_list_index.py</h4>

	> one-liner which obtains the last index of a value in a list, iterates through a reversed list based on existence condition.

+ <h4> sorting.py</h4>

	> comparison between insertion sort (using while loop / recursion / binary search), selection sort, bubble sort and merge sort. Able to sort decreasing or increasing.

+ <h4> trees.py</h4>

	> tree node class with usual methods / binary tree subclass equiped with sequential search through materialized paths / probability distribution binary tree subclass, bitvector path implementation
